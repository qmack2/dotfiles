This is just a simple script to downloads wallpapers into
a `~/Pictures/Wallpapers` and then draw the wallpaper with xwallpaper.

# Dependencies

You must have `wget` and `xwallpaper` installed.

Make sure you place this file in your `$PATH`. I have it placed in
`~/.local/bin`. Check your `$PATH` variable with `echo $PATH`.
